          <h3>Approach to care</h3>
          <p>
            Dr. Jha combines evidence-based psychiatry with psychotherapy and a compassionate, collaborative style. The
            focus is on understanding the person in their context – home, school, work and relationships – rather than
            only the diagnosis.
          </p>
          <p>
            Treatment plans are individualized and may include psycho-education, lifestyle recommendations, therapy and,
            where appropriate, medication – always discussed transparently with patients and families.
